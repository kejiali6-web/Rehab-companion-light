        <p>
          My grandfather suffered a diabetic stroke that left the right side of his body paralyzed.
          What struck me most wasn‚Äôt just the loss of movement ‚Äî it was the loss of dignity and independence.
          He, once a proud and self-reliant man, now needed help with even the most private moments.

          ‚ÄúMore than the fear of losing control of my body, I feared losing the dignity of being human.‚Äù

        <p>
          His struggle inspired me to create tools that help patients recover not just physically, but emotionally ‚Äî
          empowering them to regain confidence through small, measurable wins.

      <h3>Research & Insights</h3>
      <p>
        To understand the problem deeply, I explored both the technical and emotional aspects of rehabilitation.
        I studied modern sensor technologies and analyzed how existing devices often lack empathy in design.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Core Problem:</strong> Current rehab tools lack human-centered design.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Frontier:</strong> Studying nanosensors and soft robotics for wearable assistive tech.</li>
        <li><strong>Market & Empathy:</strong> Factory visits, user observation, and family caregiving experiences.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Week 2 ‚Äì Prototype Development</h2>

    <section id="week2-progress">
      <h3>Progress Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This week, I met with my EGR 102 professor to discuss the technical architecture of
        <strong>Rehab Companion Light</strong> and refined the prototype concept.
        With his guidance, I built the first functional diagram using
        <strong>Arduino Uno</strong> as the main controller.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Voice Feedback ‚Üí</strong> Active buzzer for encouragement & alerts.</li>
        <li><strong>Light Feedback ‚Üí</strong> Green LED (on when target pressure met) / Red LED (on when incorrect pressure detected).</li>
        <li><strong>Sensor Input ‚Üí</strong> Pressure sensor and potentiometer to detect applied force.</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty Adjustment ‚Üí</strong> Adjustable via sensor thresholds to match recovery stages.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I also learned how to use the Arduino serial monitor as a counter to track successful pressure events.
        Once a target threshold is met multiple times, the system triggers the buzzer as verbal encouragement.
        In the future, the buzzer will be replaced by a recorded voice module for more human-centered interaction.
      </p>

      <h3>Prototype Structure</h3>
      <div class="prototype-container">
        <div class="prototype-text">
          <p>
            The early-stage prototype is designed around <strong>Arduino Uno</strong> as the main controller.
            It integrates real-time pressure feedback, LED indicators, and adaptive difficulty settings
            to motivate patients through progressive rehabilitation stages.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Voice:</strong> Active buzzer to simulate verbal encouragement.</li>
            <li><strong>Light:</strong> Dual LED feedback for success/failure recognition.</li>
            <li><strong>Sensor:</strong> Pressure sensor and potentiometer for input sensing.</li>
            <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Dynamic adjustment via code-controlled thresholds.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The schematic was hand-drawn during a mentoring session, where my professor kindly lent me his personal sensor.
            This collaboration helped transform the idea into a tangible model ready for digital simulation.
