    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>My grandfather, once a proud and independent man, lost sensation on his right side after a stroke.
       Recovery was no longer just about movement ‚Äî it was about reclaiming dignity.</p>
    <blockquote>‚ÄúMore than losing control of my body, I fear losing the dignity and independence that make me human.‚Äù</blockquote>
    <p>Through caring for him, I witnessed how rehabilitation challenges go beyond physical limits ‚Äî
       they test a person‚Äôs patience, pride, and hope.</p>

  <!-- PROBLEM DIARY -->
  <section class="diary fade-in">
    <h2>Problem Observation Diary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Rehabilitation is a slow, step-by-step process. Patients often lose motivation after small setbacks.</li>
      <li>Caregivers struggle to balance respect for patients‚Äô privacy with physical assistance (e.g., toileting, dressing).</li>
      <li>Patients who lose speech ability cannot communicate their needs, leading to emotional isolation.</li>
      <li>Limited mobility reduces opportunities for social interaction, often worsening recovery.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- RESEARCH SECTION -->
  <section class="research fade-in">
    <h2>Research & Inspiration</h2>
    <p>For a research assignment, I studied a cutting-edge academic paper on continuous glucose monitoring nanosensors 
       to ground my approach in modern science.</p>
    <blockquote>
      Zubkovs, Vitalijs, et al. ‚ÄúBioengineering a Glucose Oxidase Nanosensor for Near-Infrared Continuous Glucose Monitoring.‚Äù 
      <em>Nanoscale Advances</em>, vol. 4, no. 11, 2022.
    </blockquote>
    <p>I also visited a medical device factory to better understand current rehab product design and market gaps ‚Äî 
       documenting how empathy and engineering can meet.</p>

  <section class="building fade-in">
    <h2>What I‚Äôm Building</h2>
    <p>My vision is to create assistive medical tools that blend empathy and engineering ‚Äî 
       empowering patients to regain independence, one small motion at a time.</p>
    <p>This is the beginning of my <strong>public build log</strong> ‚Äî documenting how empathy becomes engineering.</p>
