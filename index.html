        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Rehab Companion Light started from my grandfather’s rehabilitation experience.
          Many of his hand-grip exercises were repetitive and lonely, with very little
          feedback or encouragement. I wanted to build a small device that can sense grip
          strength and respond with light and personalized audio feedback.

        <ul>
          <li>Built a breadboard circuit using an FSR-402, resistors, LEDs, and a buzzer.</li>
          <li>Wrote basic Arduino code with a fixed pressure threshold to turn on LEDs and trigger the buzzer.</li>
          <li>Tested different grip strengths and confirmed that the sensor readings changed reliably.</li>

          <li>Met with Dr. Gulick to review the technical approach and clarify clinical relevance.</li>
          <li>Discussed potential risks (sensor durability, calibration, comfort) and got suggestions for next steps.</li>
          <li>Defined short-term milestones: stable sensing, encouragement mechanism, and a safe grip structure.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Formed a small cross-disciplinary team (Bioengineering + Electrical Engineering) to develop the prototype together.</li>
          <li>Designed the logic for an adaptive threshold that can increase after successful repetitions.</li>
          <li>Planned how to integrate a voice-recording module to replace the simple buzzer tone.</li>
