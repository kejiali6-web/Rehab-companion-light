    <h2>Story / Problem & Motivation</h2>
    <p>My grandfather — once strong and independent — lost sensation on the right side of his body and his ability to speak after a diabetic stroke. During his recovery, he fought not only to regain control of his body, but to reclaim his dignity.</p>

    </div>

    <blockquote>“More than losing control of my body, I fear losing the dignity and independence that make me human.”</blockquote>

    <p>Through caring for him, I witnessed how rehabilitation challenges go beyond physical limits — they test a person’s patience, pride, and hope.</p>

  <!-- PROBLEM DIARY -->
  <section class="diary fade-in">
    <h2>Problem Observation Diary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Rehabilitation is slow and fragile — small setbacks can cause patients to lose motivation.</li>
      <li>Caregivers struggle to balance assistance with patient privacy during toileting or dressing.</li>
      <li>Loss of speech limits communication, leading to emotional isolation and unmet needs.</li>
      <li>Reduced mobility leads to social withdrawal, which worsens long-term recovery.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- RESEARCH SECTION -->
  <section class="research fade-in">
    <h2>Research & Inspiration</h2>
    <p>I have been exploring literature and fieldwork to understand the physiological and emotional dimensions of diabetic stroke recovery. My readings include:</p>
    <blockquote>
      Zubkovs, Vitalijs, et al. “Bioengineering a Glucose Oxidase Nanosensor for Near-Infrared Continuous Glucose Monitoring.” <em>Nanoscale Advances</em>, 2022.<br><br>
      Feldman, Eva L., et al. “Diabetic Neuropathy.” <em>Nature Reviews Disease Primers</em>, vol. 5, no. 1, 41, 2019. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41572-019-0092-1">DOI link</a>.<br><br>
      Kim, Sehee, et al. “Dysregulated Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal Axis Is Associated With Increased Inflammation and Worse Outcomes After Ischemic Stroke in Diabetic Mice.” <em>Frontiers in Immunology</em>, vol. 13, 864858, 2022. <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.864858">DOI link</a>.
    </blockquote>
    <p>These studies deepen my understanding of how diabetes alters neural pathways and recovery responses — crucial for designing more adaptive, sensor-integrated rehabilitation tools.</p>

    <h2>Visiting Huiyang Medical Equipment Factory</h2>
    <p>
      During my field research, I visited <strong>Huiyang Medical Equipment Co., Ltd.</strong>, a rehabilitation device manufacturer producing electric and manual wheelchairs, rollators, and shower chairs.
      Observing their production lines — from aluminum alloy frames to ergonomic mesh seating — gave me insight into how engineering design translates into human comfort and accessibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huiyang’s designs emphasize mechanical safety, stability, and lightweight structure. This inspired me to consider integrating soft robotics and sensor feedback for monitoring patient posture, grip strength, and fatigue in real-time, improving user autonomy and confidence.

    <h2>What I’m Exploring</h2>
    <div class="cards">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Core Problem</h3>
        <p>Current rehabilitation tools often lack human-centered design — focusing on movement, not motivation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Technical Frontier</h3>
        <p>Exploring glucose nanosensors, wearable robotics, and adaptive feedback systems for stroke patients.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Market & Empathy</h3>
        <p>From factory visits to patient interviews — combining design, empathy, and engineering.</p>

  <section class="building fade-in">
    <h2>What I’m Building</h2>
    <p>My goal is to design assistive medical tools that blend empathy and engineering — empowering patients to regain independence, one small motion at a time.</p>
    <p>This site is the beginning of my public build log, where I document how compassion becomes engineering — from idea sketches to physical prototypes.</p>

  <!-- NEXT STEP SECTION -->
  <section class="next-step fade-in">
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Build a prototype using sensor and light feedback.</li>
      <li>Test with users and gather data.</li>
      <li>Share weekly progress updates and reflections.</li>
    </ul>
