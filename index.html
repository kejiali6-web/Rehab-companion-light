    <h2>Week 1 – Story, Research & Motivation</h2>
    <div class="story-container">
      <div class="story-text">
        <p>
          My grandfather suffered a diabetic stroke that left the right side of his body paralyzed.
          What struck me most wasn’t just the loss of movement — it was the loss of dignity and independence.
          He, once a proud and self-reliant man, now needed help with even the most private moments.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “More than the fear of losing control of my body, I feared losing the dignity of being human.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          His struggle inspired me to create tools that help patients recover not just physically, but emotionally —
          empowering them to regain confidence through small, measurable wins.

    <h3>Problem Observation Diary</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Rehabilitation is long and incremental; small failures can erase motivation.</li>
      <li>Caregivers struggle to balance physical help and respect for privacy.</li>
      <li>Patients with speech loss can’t communicate their needs effectively.</li>
      <li>Limited mobility leads to social isolation and emotional withdrawal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Factory Visit – Huiyang Medical Equipment</h3>
    <p>
      I visited a medical device factory to observe how wheelchairs and assistive tools are made. Seeing foam densities,
      frame bending, and caster alignment helped me connect design precision with user comfort and dignity.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Seat & backrest: foam hardness affects pressure comfort.</li>
      <li>Material trade-offs between cleanability and breathability.</li>
      <li>Designing modular components allows easier upgrades for users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Next Steps (Week 1)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Build a public website for documentation.</li>
      <li>✅ Outline assistive device concept with feedback design.</li>
      <li>⏳ Conduct interviews with caregivers/patients.</li>
      <li>⏳ Define success metrics (e.g., pressure repetition count).</li>

    <h2>Week 2 – Prototype Development</h2>
    <p>
      This week, I met with my EGR 102 professor to refine the prototype’s structure.
      Together, we mapped out a system using <strong>Arduino Uno</strong> as the controller,
      focusing on feedback through light, sound, and pressure sensors.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Voice Feedback → Active buzzer for encouragement & alerts.</li>
      <li>Light Feedback → Green LED (target met) / Red LED (needs correction).</li>
      <li>Sensor Input → Pressure sensor + potentiometer.</li>
      <li>Difficulty Adjustment → Threshold-based scaling for recovery stages.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="prototype-container">
      <div class="prototype-text">
        <p>
          The prototype promotes effort recognition — not just movement detection. 
          It rewards correct pressure with light and tone, helping stroke patients feel progress in real time.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Controller: Arduino Uno</li>
          <li>Inputs: Pressure Sensor & Potentiometer</li>
          <li>Outputs: Green/Red LEDs, Buzzer</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Arduino Logic Example</h3>
    <pre><code>
int pressurePin = A0;
int greenLED = 8;
int redLED = 9;
int buzzer = 10;
int threshold = 500;
int count = 0;

void setup() {
  pinMode(greenLED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(redLED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(buzzer, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int pressure = analogRead(pressurePin);
  if (pressure > threshold) {
    digitalWrite(greenLED, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(redLED, LOW);
    count++;
    if (count % 5 == 0) tone(buzzer, 1000, 200);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(redLED, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(greenLED, LOW);
  }
}
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Next Steps (Week 2)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>⏳ Build a small Tinkercad simulation.</li>
      <li>⏳ Test the breadboard version with real sensors.</li>
      <li>⏳ Replace buzzer with pre-recorded voice feedback.</li>
      <li>⏳ Add counter display and data tracking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="highlight">Week 3 – Validation & Feedback</h2>
    <p>
      This week marks the public launch of <strong>Rehab Companion Light</strong> as part of the final Delta Residency deliverable.
      I focused on validating the idea through open sharing and inviting early interest from peers, mentors, and anyone passionate
      about human-centered rehabilitation technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      I published a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kejia-liu-92559633b" target="_blank">LinkedIn post</a>,
      shared the <a href="https://kejiali6-web.github.io/Rehab-companion-light/" target="_blank">build log website</a>,
      and created a short survey form to gather potential testers and feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even without many responses yet, this launch helped me learn to communicate both the technical and emotional sides of my work.
      It reaffirmed my goal: turning empathy into engineering.
    </p>
    <h3>Next Steps (Week 3)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Run a small Tinkercad simulation with LEDs and sensors.</li>
      <li>Integrate a basic voice module for emotional feedback.</li>
      <li>Interview rehabilitation practitioners for design validation.</li>
      <li>Improve ergonomics and hygiene design for the physical prototype.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption">🌟 Week 3 is less about perfection, and more about connection — bringing empathy to engineering.</p>
