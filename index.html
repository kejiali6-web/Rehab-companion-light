    <h2 class="highlight">Week 3 – Validation & Feedback</h2>
    <p>
      This week marks the public launch of <strong>Rehab Companion Light</strong> as part of the final Delta Residency deliverable.
      I focused on validating the concept through open sharing and inviting early interest from peers, mentors, and anyone passionate about
      human-centered rehabilitation technology.
    </p>

    <p>
      I published a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kejia-liu-92559633b" target="_blank">LinkedIn post</a> introducing the project,
      shared the <a href="https://kejiali6-web.github.io/Rehab-companion-light/" target="_blank">build log website</a>,
      and created a short survey form to gather potential testers and feedback.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even without many responses yet, launching publicly helped me practice communicating both the technical and emotional essence of my work —
      translating compassion into engineering. I now have a clearer direction for what comes next.
    </p>

    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Run a small Tinkercad simulation using LEDs, buzzer, and pressure sensor to visualize response timing.</li>
      <li>Integrate a simple voice module to provide emotional, human-like encouragement feedback.</li>
      <li>Interview 2–3 rehabilitation practitioners to evaluate practicality and comfort factors.</li>
      <li>Design the prototype casing with better ergonomics, portability, and hygiene considerations.</li>
    </ul>

      🌟 Week 3 is less about perfection and more about connection — building something real, visible, and human.
