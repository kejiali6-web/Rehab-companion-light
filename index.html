        <h3>Story & Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          My grandfather suffered a diabetic stroke that left the right side of his body paralyzed and his speech impaired.
          What struck me most wasn’t just the loss of movement — it was the loss of dignity and independence.
          He, once a proud and self-reliant man, now needed help with even the most private moments.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “More than the fear of losing control of my body, I feared losing the dignity and independence that make me human.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          His struggle inspired me to create tools that help patients recover not just physically, but emotionally —
          empowering them to regain confidence through small, measurable wins.

      <h3>Problem Observation Diary</h3>
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li><strong>Fragile morale in long rehab:</strong> rehabilitation is long and incremental; even small failures can erase motivation.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy vs. caregiving:</strong> it’s hard to balance essential care (toileting, dressing) with preserving dignity.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication loss:</strong> aphasia makes it difficult to express needs; many internal needs go unheard.</li>
        <li><strong>Social isolation:</strong> physical limits reduce activity and social life; isolation harms recovery.</li>

      <h3>Factory Visit – Huiyang Medical Equipment</h3>
      <p>
        I visited a medical device factory to observe how wheelchairs and assistive tools are made. Seeing foam densities,
        frame bending, caster alignment, and fabric tensioning in person helped me connect comfort, durability, and
        manufacturability with human-centered needs.

        <div class="card">
          <h4>What I Observed</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Seat & backrest: foam hardness and contour directly affect pressure distribution.</li>
            <li>Frames & joints: repeatability in bends/welds → comfort consistency and safety.</li>
            <li>Materials: trade-off between breathable fabric vs. easy-to-clean surfaces.</li>

          <h4>Design Implications</h4>

    <h2>Week 2 – Prototype Development</h2>

    <!-- Progress Overview -->
    <section id="week2-progress" class="subsection">
      <h3>Progress Overview</h3>
      <p>
        I met with my EGR 102 professor to refine the prototype architecture for <strong>Rehab Companion Light</strong>.
        We mapped the first system using <strong>Arduino Uno</strong> as the controller and focused on four feedback aspects.
        He also lent me a personal sensor to kickstart the hardware exploration.
      </p>
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li><strong>Voice Feedback →</strong> <em>active buzzer</em> for now (future: voice module).</li>
        <li><strong>Light Feedback →</strong> green LED (on when target pressure met) / red LED (on until corrected).</li>
        <li><strong>Sensor Input →</strong> pressure sensor + potentiometer to detect applied force.</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty Adjustment →</strong> thresholds tuned to match rehab stages.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I also set up a simple <em>serial monitor counter</em> to track successful attempts. After N successes,
        the system triggers a short buzzer “reward.” (Future: replace buzzer with short human voice prompt.)

            Early-stage prototype intent: provide <strong>immediate, understandable feedback</strong> during grip/press tasks.
            The device motivates progress via lights and simple audio, while difficulty scales with recovery.
          </p>
          <ul class="bullet">
            <li><strong>Controller:</strong> Arduino Uno</li>
            <li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Pressure sensor (FSR-like) & potentiometer</li>
            <li><strong>Outputs:</strong> Green/Red LEDs, active buzzer</li>

            This hand-drawn schematic was created in a mentoring session. It translates empathy-driven design into a
            buildable circuit that can be simulated before physical prototyping.
